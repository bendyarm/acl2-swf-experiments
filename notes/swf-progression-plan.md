# Software Foundations Book 1 (Logical Foundations) - ACL2 Progression Plan

## Overview

This document maps theorems and exercises from Software Foundations Volume 1 (Logical Foundations) that we aim to replicate in ACL2. The goal is to work through fundamental concepts systematically, adapting Coq proofs to ACL2's theorem prover.

## Chapter Status

### âœ… Chapter 3: Induction - COMPLETED
- [x] `add_0_r`: n + 0 = n
- [x] `minus_n_n`: n - n = 0
- [x] `mul_0_r`: n * 0 = 0
- [x] `plus_n_Sm`: S(n + m) = n + S(m)
- [x] `add_comm`: n + m = m + n
- [x] `add_assoc`: n + (m + p) = (n + m) + p

**Location**: `experiments/arithmetic/experiment-02-induction-basics.lisp`

### âœ… Chapter 4: Lists - COMPLETED
- [x] `nil_app`: [] ++ l = l
- [x] `app_assoc`: (l1 ++ l2) ++ l3 = l1 ++ (l2 ++ l3)
- [x] `rev_length`: length(rev(l)) = length(l)
- [x] `rev_app_distr`: rev(l1 ++ l2) = rev(l2) ++ rev(l1)
- [x] `rev_involutive`: rev(rev(l)) = l
- [x] `app_nil_r`: l ++ [] = l

**Location**: `experiments/lists/experiment-01-list-basics.lisp`
**Key techniques learned**: Helper lemmas about `revappend`, theory control with `:in-theory (disable ...)`

### ðŸ“‹ Chapter 2: Basics - NEXT TARGET

Theorems about Natural Numbers:
- [ ] `plus_O_n`: 0 + n = n
- [ ] `plus_1_l`: 1 + n = S n
- [ ] `mult_0_l`: 0 * n = 0
- [ ] `mult_n_1`: n * 1 = n
- [ ] `plus_id_example`: Properties of addition identities

**Suggested location**: `experiments/arithmetic/experiment-03-basics.lisp`

### ðŸ“‹ Chapter 5: Polymorphism (Poly)

Higher-order function theorems:
- [ ] `map_rev`: map f (rev l) = rev (map f l)
- [ ] `fold_length`: Proving fold-based length function correct
- [ ] `flat_map`: Properties of flatMap operation
- [ ] Theorems about `filter`, `map`, `fold`

**Suggested location**: `experiments/lists/experiment-02-higher-order.lisp`
**Challenge**: ACL2 handles polymorphism differently from Coq - may need to prove for specific types

### ðŸ“‹ Chapter 7: Logic

Logical connectives and reasoning:
- [ ] Conjunction commutativity: A âˆ§ B â†” B âˆ§ A
- [ ] Conjunction associativity: (A âˆ§ B) âˆ§ C â†” A âˆ§ (B âˆ§ C)
- [ ] Disjunction commutativity: A âˆ¨ B â†” B âˆ¨ A
- [ ] De Morgan's laws
- [ ] Excluded middle variants (constructive logic considerations)

**Suggested location**: `experiments/logic/experiment-01-connectives.lisp`
**Challenge**: ACL2 uses classical logic, Coq uses constructive logic - some theorems may differ

### ðŸ“‹ Chapter 8: Inductively Defined Propositions (IndProp)

Inductive predicates:
- [ ] `evenb` predicate and proofs
- [ ] Regular expression matching
- [ ] Reflexive transitive closure
- [ ] Permutation relation

**Suggested location**: `experiments/logic/experiment-02-inductive-predicates.lisp`
**Challenge**: ACL2's defun-sk vs Coq's Inductive propositions

### ðŸ“‹ Chapter 9: Total and Partial Maps

Data structure theorems:
- [ ] Map update properties
- [ ] Map equivalence theorems
- [ ] Functional correctness of map operations

**Suggested location**: `experiments/data-structures/experiment-01-maps.lisp`

## Topics We May Skip or Adapt

### Coq-Specific Concepts
- **Tactics and proof automation** - ACL2 has different automation (hints, computed hints)
- **Proof objects and term extraction** - ACL2's architecture differs fundamentally
- **Module system details** - ACL2 uses packages differently

### Advanced Topics (for later)
- **Chapter 10+**: ImpParser, Extraction, Auto - more advanced, may tackle after basics

## Mapping Coq Concepts to ACL2

| Coq | ACL2 | Notes |
|-----|------|-------|
| `Inductive nat` | Built-in natural numbers | ACL2 has rationals, use `natp` for naturals |
| `Fixpoint` | `defun` | Must prove termination |
| `Theorem` / `Lemma` | `defthm` | Same concept |
| `simpl` | Automatic simplification | ACL2 does this automatically |
| `rewrite` | `:rewrite` rules | Similar but ACL2's are automatic |
| `induction` | Automatic induction | ACL2 chooses induction scheme |
| `destruct` | Pattern matching in proof | ACL2 does case splits |
| Polymorphism | Type-generic with guards | Different approach |

## Learning Goals

1. **Foundation**: Master basic arithmetic and list proofs (âœ… Done)
2. **Techniques**: Learn helper lemmas, theory control, induction schemes
3. **Advanced**: Tackle higher-order functions, inductive predicates
4. **Patterns**: Build a library of reusable proof patterns

## Progress Tracking

- **Completed**: 12 theorems (6 arithmetic, 6 list)
- **Next target**: Basics chapter (5-10 more theorems)
- **Total chapters to cover**: ~6-8 core chapters

## Notes on ACL2 vs Coq

**Advantages of ACL2**:
- Powerful automatic proof search
- Strong arithmetic decision procedures
- Mature standard library

**Challenges**:
- Must understand rewrite loops and theory control
- Need to know underlying function definitions (e.g., `revappend` for `reverse`)
- Less interactive feedback than Coq's tactic-based approach
